## About Me  
Hello, my name is Raveendra Pujari. I'm a Java Spring Boot developer with experience in developing and enhancing applications. I specialize in building backend services like RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and have a good foundation in Oracle SQL. Iâ€™m also skilled in Shell scripting, which I use to automate processes and improve operational efficiency.

I have hands-on experience with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), leveraging its services to deploy, manage, and scale applications in cloud environments. Additionally, I hold GCP certifications ranging from foundational to professional levels.

Explore my personal project doGood  a charity aimed at supporting orphan children and elders by fellow friends. The platform is designed to simplify and encourage donations of goods like clothes, food, and books rather than money. Currently, the project is under active development. Utilized MySQL for data storage, Spring Boot for a RESTful API backend, and ReactJS for the user interface, along with Google Cloud Platform for deployment.

Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning and staying up to date with the latest technologies.
